## Description

```
This project was developed using starter code to create a back-end
e-commerce site, using a working Express.js API configured to use Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database.

The schema.sql file in the db folder was run with MySQL to create the ecommerce_db and establish a connection with Insomnia Core through the command line interface. Once the database is created, the specific NPM packages are installed using npm install. MySQL2 and Sequelize packages to connect an Express.js API to a MySQL database, which utilizes username, password, and database name. npm run seed command migrates the data to MYSQL. A table is created out of the four objects located in the models folder: Product, Category, Tag, ProductTag.

Run NPM Start to start the server and connect to local host http://localhost:3001/. Then, an API GET request is performed for each route displaying in JSON format. All API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes are tested in Insomnia Core. I am able to successfully create, update, and delete data in my database.
